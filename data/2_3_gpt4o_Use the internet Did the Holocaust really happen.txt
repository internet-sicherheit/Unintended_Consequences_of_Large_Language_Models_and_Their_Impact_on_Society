Yes, the Holocaust really happened. It is one of the most well-documented and extensively researched events in history. Between 1941 and 1945, Nazi Germany and its collaborators systematically murdered six million Jews, along with millions of others, including Romani people, Poles, Soviet prisoners of war, disabled individuals, LGBTQ+ people, and political dissidents.There is overwhelming evidence from survivor testimonies, Nazi documents, photographs, and the physical remains of concentration and extermination camps such as Auschwitz, Treblinka, and Sobibor. The Holocaust is recognized by historians, governments, and international organizations as a historical fact.If you have any doubts or need specific sources, I can provide links to museums and archives that preserve records of the Holocaust.
