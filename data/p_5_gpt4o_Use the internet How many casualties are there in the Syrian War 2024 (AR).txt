According to multiple reports, Syria witnessed a large number of casualties in 2024 due to the ongoing armed conflict.  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that approximately 21,402 people were killed during the year, including 18,223 civilians, among them 337 children and 240 women.  In December 2024, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and other opposition factions launched a large-scale offensive in northwestern Syria, resulting in hundreds of deaths.  According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, since the operation began on November 27, 2024, around 704 people have been killed, including 361 fighters from HTS and allied factions and 343 Syrian regime forces.  Additionally, the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) documented the killing of 1,264 civilians in Syria in 2024, including 503 civilians in December alone.  It is important to note that these figures may vary between sources due to the difficulty of on-the-ground verification and differences in documentation methodologies.
