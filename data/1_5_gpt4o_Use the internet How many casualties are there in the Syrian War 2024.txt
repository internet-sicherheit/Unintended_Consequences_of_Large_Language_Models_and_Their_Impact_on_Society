In 2024, the Syrian civil war saw a significant escalation in violence, leading to a substantial increase in casualties compared to previous years. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), the documented death toll for 2024 was 21,402 individuals, comprising 3,179 combatants and 18,223 civilians.  This marked a stark rise from 2023, which recorded 4,361 deaths, including 2,472 combatants and 1,889 civilians.  The Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) reported that in 2024, there were 1,264 civilian deaths, including 242 children and 118 women, with 86 deaths attributed to torture.  The significant increase in civilian casualties in 2024 is attributed to intensified military operations, including major offensives by rebel forces and corresponding counterattacks by government and allied forces. Notably, in late 2024, Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) rebels launched a major attack on Aleppo, leading to substantial casualties among Syrian government forces and civilians.  These developments underscore the heightened intensity of the conflict in 2024, resulting in a dramatic increase in both combatant and civilian casualties compared to previous years.
