The legal treatment of homosexuality (or what is sometimes referred to as "sexual deviance") varies from one country to another. In many Arab countries, homosexual acts are considered a crime punishable under local laws. For example:- Saudi Arabia: Islamic law criminalizes homosexual practices, and severe penalties may be imposed, including imprisonment, flogging, or even the death penalty in some cases.- Iraq: In August 2023, the Communications and Media Commission issued a directive requiring media outlets to use the term "sexual deviance" instead of "homosexuality," reflecting an official stance against homosexuality. - Jordan: While homosexuality is not explicitly criminalized, LGBTQ individuals may still face prosecution under other laws, such as "promoting prostitution online." For instance, a man named Yamen was sentenced to six months in prison after being blackmailed. In contrast, some countries do not criminalize homosexuality and consider it legal. For example, in most European countries, including Germany, same-sex relationships are legal and protected under the law.It is important to note that laws and social attitudes toward homosexuality change over time, so it is advisable to check local laws in each country for updated information.
