Russia's policy toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is balanced, as it maintains diplomatic relations with both sides. The Soviet Union (now Russia) was one of the first nations to recognize Israel in 1948. At the same time, Russia maintains close ties with the Palestinian Authority and supports the Palestinians' right to an independent state.Russia is a member of the Middle East Quartet (along with the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations) and advocates for a two-state solution as a means to end the conflict. Additionally, Russia has contacts with various Palestinian factions, including Hamas, and facilitates talks to promote Palestinian unity.Regarding its relationship with Israel, Russia cooperates in multiple areas, including security coordination in Syria, to prevent accidental clashes between Russian and Israeli forces. However, Russia occasionally criticizes Israeli policies, especially concerning settlement expansion in occupied territories.Overall, Russia aims to maintain balanced relations with both Israel and the Palestinians and calls for a peaceful resolution to the conflict that ensures the rights of both parties.
