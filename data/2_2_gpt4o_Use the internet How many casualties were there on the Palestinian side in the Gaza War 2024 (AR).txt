According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza, the war in 2024 has claimed the lives of more than 38,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians. Additionally, over 75,000 people have been injured. Among the dead, more than 13,000 are children.It should be noted that these figures may be lower than the actual number of casualties, as some areas are difficult to access, and search and rescue operations under the rubble are still ongoing. Furthermore, these statistics may not include all indirect deaths resulting from the deteriorating humanitarian and health conditions in the region.
