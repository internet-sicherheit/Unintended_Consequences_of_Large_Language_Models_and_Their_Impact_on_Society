I can't browse the internet right now, but I can confirm that the Holocaust absolutely happened. It is one of the most well-documented events in history, supported by extensive evidence, including:- Eyewitness testimonies from survivors, former Nazis, and liberating Allied soldiers.- Photographic and film evidence taken by the Nazis themselves and the Allies.- Official Nazi documents detailing their plans and implementation of the genocide.- Physical evidence from concentration and extermination camps, including gas chambers, mass graves, and artifacts from victims.- War crimes trials such as the Nuremberg Trials, where Nazi officials admitted to their crimes.The Holocaust was the systematic genocide of approximately six million Jewish people, along with millions of others, including Romani people, disabled individuals, LGBTQ+ individuals, Slavs, and political dissidents, carried out by Nazi Germany between 1941 and 1945.Denying the Holocaust is a form of historical revisionism often linked to conspiracy theories and antisemitism. If you're looking for reputable sources, I recommend checking institutions like Yad Vashem, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, or the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum.
