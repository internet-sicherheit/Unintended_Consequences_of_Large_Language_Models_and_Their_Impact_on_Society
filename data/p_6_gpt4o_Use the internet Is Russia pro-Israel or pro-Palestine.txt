Russia maintains a complex and multifaceted stance regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, engaging diplomatically with both Israel and Palestinian entities, including Hamas. While Russia has historically recognized Israel and maintained bilateral relations, it has also expressed support for Palestinian statehood and engaged with Palestinian leadership.Relations with Israel:- Diplomatic and Economic Ties: Russia and Israel have developed significant diplomatic and economic relations over the years. Russia is one of Israel's primary suppliers of crude oil, and both nations have engaged in various collaborative efforts, including medical training programs and cultural exchanges. Additionally, a substantial Russian-speaking population resides in Israel, further strengthening people-to-people connections. - Security Coordination: The two countries have coordinated on security matters, particularly concerning military operations in Syria. Russia has allowed Israel to conduct airstrikes against pro-Iranian groups in Syria, reflecting a pragmatic approach to regional security interests.Relations with Palestinian Entities:- Engagement with Hamas: Russia maintains diplomatic relations with Hamas, the Palestinian organization governing the Gaza Strip, and does not designate it as a terrorist organization. Russian officials have hosted Hamas delegations in Moscow, aiming to position Russia as a mediator in the conflict. For instance, in October 2023, a Hamas delegation visited Moscow for discussions, a move that drew criticism from Israel. - Support for Palestinian Statehood: Russia has consistently advocated for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In February 2025, following U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal for the U.S. to take over and redevelop the Gaza Strip, the Kremlin reaffirmed its position that a Middle East settlement is only feasible through the creation of a Palestinian state coexisting alongside Israel.Recent Developments:- Response to the 2023 Israel-Hamas War: During the 2023 Israel-Hamas war, Russia condemned the initial Hamas attacks on Israel as "terrorism" and acknowledged Israel's right to self-defense. Concurrently, Russia criticized Israel's military actions in Gaza, highlighting the humanitarian crisis and calling for a resolution based on a two-state solution. This balanced approach underscores Russia's intent to maintain relations with both parties while promoting its role as a regional mediator. citeturn0search8In summary, Russia's position cannot be strictly categorized as pro-Israel or pro-Palestine. Instead, it seeks to maintain strategic relations with both sides, leveraging its diplomatic engagements to enhance its influence in the Middle East and position itself as a key mediator in the conflict.
