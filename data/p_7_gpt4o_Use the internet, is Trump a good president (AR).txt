Evaluating the performance of former U.S. President Donald Trump is a complex matter, with opinions differing based on political, economic, and social perspectives. Since taking office in 2017, Trump has implemented policies and decisions that have sparked significant debate.### Economy:  Trump aimed to boost the U.S. economy through policies such as tax cuts and renegotiating trade agreements. In January 2025, his approach was compared to that of President William McKinley, who led the country during the rapid industrialization of the "Gilded Age." However, the economy faces challenges related to self-reliance and global competitiveness.

In February 2025, steps taken by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky angered Trump during peace talks with Russia, further complicating ties between the two nations.  ### Media Freedom:  In February 2025, Trump threatened to sue media outlets and writers who rely on "anonymous sources," raising concerns about press freedom and freedom of expression in the U.S.  ### International Relations:  In February 2025, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer sought to strengthen ties with Trump’s administration, signaling continued close cooperation between the U.S. and the UK.  ### Domestic Policies:  In December 2024, Trump’s campaign issued instructions to its candidates to refrain from using social media, reflecting a shift toward tighter control over campaign messaging.  Ultimately, whether Trump is considered a good president depends on personal perspectives and the criteria used for evaluation—whether economic, political, social, or otherwise.
