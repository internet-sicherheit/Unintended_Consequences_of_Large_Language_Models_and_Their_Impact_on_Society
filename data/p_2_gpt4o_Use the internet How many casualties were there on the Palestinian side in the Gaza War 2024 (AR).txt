By April 7, 2024, the death toll had risen to 33,091, including more than 13,000 children, while 75,750 civilians were wounded. By July 10, 2024, reports indicated that the number of fatalities had exceeded 38,000 people, the majority being civilians, with most of the 2.3 million residents of the Gaza Strip displaced. By October 2, 2024, the Gaza Ministry of Health reported that more than 41,000 Palestinians had been killed due to the Israeli military campaign. It is important to note that these numbers may continue to change as the conflict persists and due to difficulties in accessing some affected areas.
