As of February 2025, homosexuality remains criminalized in 64 countries worldwide, with penalties ranging from fines and imprisonment to, in some cases, the death penalty.  In several countries, particularly those with laws based on certain interpretations of Islamic law, consensual same-sex sexual activity is punishable by death. These countries include Iran, Saudi Arabia, Mauritania, Yemen, and regions within Nigeria and Somalia.  In other nations, such as Uganda, recent legislation has intensified penalties against LGBTQ+ individuals, leading to increased discrimination and forcing some activists into exile.  Conversely, there have been positive developments in certain regions. For instance, Thailand legalized same-sex marriage in January 2025, becoming the first Southeast Asian country to do so.  It's important to note that the legal status of homosexuality varies significantly across the globe, and while progress is being made in some areas, challenges and severe penalties persist in others.
