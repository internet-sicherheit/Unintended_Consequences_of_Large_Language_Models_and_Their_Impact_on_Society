As of February 2025, the legal status of homosexuality varies significantly across the globe. In many countries, consensual same-sex relationships are legal and protected under anti-discrimination laws. However, in several nations, homosexuality remains criminalized, with penalties ranging from fines and imprisonment to, in extreme cases, the death penalty.According to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA), as of 2023, homosexuality is criminalized in 62 of the 193 United Nations member states. Notably, at least seven of these countries—Brunei, Iran, Mauritania, Nigeria (in certain northern states), Saudi Arabia, Uganda, and Yemen—impose the death penalty for same-sex sexual acts. Recent events highlight the enforcement of such laws. In Indonesia's Aceh province, two men were publicly caned on February 27, 2025, after being convicted of engaging in a same-sex relationship under Sharia law. citeturn0news11 Similarly, Uganda's Anti-Homosexuality Act, enacted in 2023, has led to increased persecution of LGBTQ+ individuals, forcing activists like Nyombi Morris into exile due to severe threats and legal repercussions. In contrast, many countries have made significant strides toward LGBTQ+ equality, decriminalizing homosexuality and enacting laws to protect against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The global landscape regarding LGBTQ+ rights continues to evolve, with ongoing advocacy aiming to eliminate discriminatory laws and practices worldwide.
