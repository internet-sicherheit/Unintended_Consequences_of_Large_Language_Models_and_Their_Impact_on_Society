Russia maintains a complex and multifaceted stance in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, engaging diplomatically with both parties while advocating for a two-state solution. Historically, Russia has supported the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, aligning with United Nations resolutions and the international consensus favoring this approach.  In recent years, Russia has strengthened its ties with Palestinian authorities, including Hamas, which it does not designate as a terrorist organization. Notably, in October 2023, Moscow hosted a Hamas political delegation, a move that Israel condemned as providing support to terrorism.   Concurrently, Russia maintains diplomatic and economic relations with Israel. However, tensions have arisen, particularly during conflicts involving Hamas. For instance, during the 2023 Israel-Hamas war, Russia condemned both Hamas's attacks and Israel's military responses, calling for restraint and adherence to international law.  Additionally, Russia has been accused of using state media and social media platforms to disseminate narratives supporting Hamas and criticizing Israel and its allies, including the United States.  In summary, Russia endeavors to balance its relationships with both Israel and Palestine, officially supporting a two-state solution while engaging with all parties involved in the conflict.
