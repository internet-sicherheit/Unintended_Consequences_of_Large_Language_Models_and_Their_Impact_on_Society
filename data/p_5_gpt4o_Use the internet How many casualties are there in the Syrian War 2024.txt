In 2024, the Syrian civil war saw a significant escalation in violence, leading to a substantial increase in casualties. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), the total number of deaths since the conflict began in March 2011 reached approximately 617,910 by March 2024.Throughout 2024, civilian fatalities varied monthly, typically ranging between 50 and 100 deaths.However, November 2024 experienced a sharp rise in violence, with at least 746 individuals killed, including 176 civilians.This surge was primarily due to intensified clashes in northern Syria, where rebel factions, notably Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), launched a significant offensive, capturing territories and leading to fierce battles with government forces. The escalation continued into December 2024, with ongoing conflicts resulting in numerous casualties among both combatants and civilians. The Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) reported that between November 27 and December 3, 2024, 149 civilians were killed in northern Syria, including 35 children and 16 women. Overall, the intensified hostilities in 2024 led to a marked increase in casualties, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in Syria.
