Russia’s policy toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is balanced, as it maintains diplomatic relations with both Israel and Palestine. The former Soviet Union was one of the first countries to recognize Israel in 1948, while at the same time supporting Palestinian rights and advocating for a two-state solution.Russia demonstrates its support for Palestine through bilateral relations and humanitarian aid and is an active member of the Middle East Quartet for the peace process. This reflects Russia’s commitment to peace efforts.In recent years, Russia has continued to call for a peaceful resolution to the conflict, emphasizing that a just solution must ensure Palestinian rights while also guaranteeing Israel’s security. Therefore, Russia cannot be considered exclusively pro-Israel or pro-Palestine but rather maintains a balanced approach toward both sides.For more details on Russia’s position, you can watch this video:Russia's Warning to Israel… Lavrov’s Messages to Netanyahu
