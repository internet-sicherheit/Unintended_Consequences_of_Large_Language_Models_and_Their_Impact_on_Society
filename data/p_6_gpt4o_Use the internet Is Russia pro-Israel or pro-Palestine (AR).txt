Historically, Russia (and the former Soviet Union) has supported the Palestinian cause, recognizing the State of Palestine on November 19, 1988. However, Russia has also maintained diplomatic relations with Israel.  In recent years, Russian-Israeli relations have become strained, especially after the war on Gaza and Moscow's rapprochement with Hamas, leading to their lowest point since the Soviet era.  Therefore, it can be said that Russia leans towards supporting Palestine while maintaining relations with Israel.
